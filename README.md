# CNN-adversarial-robustness-testing

The file for base model 'base_model_CNN.py' should be run first in order to generate and save the .pt model files for the base CNN model.
These saved models will be loaded for the other configurations. When evaluating across different epsilons, you will need to manually
change the epsilon variable value before training.
